            I build streaming and batch data pipelines with tools like Airflow and Mage, creating efficient workflows that make data talk. Skilled in setting up and managing databases using BigQuery, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, and designing schemas that make sense. I use Python for everything from data wrangling with Pandas and NumPy to analysis with Spark and creating visuals with Matplotlib. Also, Iâ€™m good at turning data into insights with dashboards in Tableau, Looker, and Sigma.

            I&apos;m experienced with Docker, using it to package my applications into containers. My project, Livy, runs on a Dockerized server managed by Kubernetes on Digital Ocean. I&apos;m still growing my Kubernetes skills. Also, I&apos;m experienced with Git and version control, keeping projects organized and workflows efficient.

            I build AI applications using LLM models and Langchain&apos;s AgentExecutors. I use OpenAI and Langchain in Livy for various functionality such as research and idea generation for students, summarizing/refactoring content for better clarify and understanding. I also use RAG and vectordbs for knowledge retrieval.

              I build end-to-end web applications with modern tools and frameworks. I&apos;ve used TypeScript and Next.js to create the very website you&apos;re looking at now. On the backend, I&apos;m comfortable with Django and Flask, which power my project Livy, making database interactions a breeze with ORM. I also have a good grounding in JavaScript, React, and some Java to round out my toolkit.
